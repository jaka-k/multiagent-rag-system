# Workflow Branching into Subgraphs
# Main Flow: Processes input data to produce outputs and logs.
# Branching Point: After the main processing, the flow splits into two independent paths (subgraphs).
# Subgraph 1 (Output Summarization): Takes the successful outputs and creates a summary report.
# Subgraph 2 (Failure Summarization): Analyzes logs to identify and summarize any failure modes.

# Prompt: That's very interesting that you propose it like this. This would make the app very fast.
# It would allow me to incorporate additional functionality at a later point.
